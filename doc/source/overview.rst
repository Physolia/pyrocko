standalone tools for everyday seismological practice:

* :doc:`apps/snuffler/index`: an extensible seismogram browser and workbench
* :doc:`apps/cake/index`: travel-time and ray-path computations for 1D layered earthmodels
* :doc:`apps/fomosto/index`: a tool to manage pre-calculated Green's function stores
* :doc:`apps/jackseis/index`: a command-line tool for common waveform archive data manipulations
