Installation
============

Pyrocko can be installed on any operating system where its prerequisites are
available.

Under **Linux**, we recommend to use the system's **native package manager** to
install the prerequisites and to install Pyrocko **from source**. Using
third-party package managers like *pip* or *conda* often leads to
conflicts. Follow the instructions in :doc:`system/index`.

For **Anaconda** users, prebuilt packages are available (see
:doc:`packages/anaconda`). Also packages for **pip** are available
(see :doc:`packages/pip`).

For additional information, refer to :doc:`details`.
